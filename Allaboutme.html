		<p id="me"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hello. 
		As you already know my name is Coconut Muller.
		I am a dog breed called a samoyed.
		All of us have this beautiful, white coat.
		I am four years old and live in Middle Village, New York.
		I have 2 sisters and even have an Instagram which you can access upove. 
		I was born on February 10, 2014 and the Muller's adopted me when I was only 6 weeks old.
		some of my favorite foods are tomatoes, grapes, frosty paws, and snausages. There are too many to name them all.
		For fun I like to play fetch, play tug of war, and trying to bite the water that comes out of the hose. </p>
